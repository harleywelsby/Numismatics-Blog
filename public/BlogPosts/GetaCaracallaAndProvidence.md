One of my best-preserved Roman denarii depicts Geta (209-211 AD), and the goddess Providentia. The type was struck from 203-208 under the co-emperorship of Geta's father and brother, Septimius Severus (193-211) and Caracalla (198-217). Not only does this coin feature an incredible portrait of Geta, but it also tells a fascinating story of internal conflict and intrigue in the Severan Dynasty.

Taking power in 193, Septimius Severus struck a significant number of coins depicting his sons Caracalla and Geta. His intention was to display his family to the public as the rightful imperial family and concrete their right to succession after his death. When the emperor (or "Augustus") declares their heir, this is done by assigning them the title "Caesar". On the obverse legend of the denarius above, we can read "P SEPTIMIVS GETA CAES", or "Publius Septimius Geta, Caesar". This indicates that Geta was set to inherit the title of Augustus upon his father's death.

Severus often chose to convey the message of succession via the goddess Providentia, the divine personification of the ability to foresee and provision. The use of Providentia on the denarius above implies "divine providence" over Geta's right to rule. This message indicated that the Gods favoured Geta as a ruler, and as such, preventing or upsetting his reign would be an affront to said Gods.

On the type above specifically, we can see Providentia waving a wand over a globe. This is an interesting message for two reasons; it indicates the Caesar Geta's "power over the world", but is also one of many remnants that tell us the Romans were aware the Earth was round.

Geta was promoted from Caesar to Augustus in late 209 AD, and upon his father's death in 211 AD, he was promoted to senior and equal emperor alongside his brother Caracalla.

Geta and Caracalla despised each other. Under their joint rule, the Imperial Palace was literally divided in two. Each brother took a section and forbid each other and their respective servants from crossing sections. The two only met in the presence of their mother Julia Domna, who the Roman historian Herodian claims talked the brothers down from splitting the Empire in two.

In late 211 AD, nearly 1 year after Severus' death, Caracalla arranged a peace deal with Geta at their mother's apartment. Geta arrived without his bodyguards, and Caracalla thus had his Praetorian Guard murder Geta in front of their own mother.

Ironically, Caracalla blamed the murder on Providentia. He claimed that Geta's murder was necessary to impose his own "divine providence" to rule. The denarius of Geta above thus depicts an ironic, unfortunate series of events in the reign of the Severan Dynasty. A message of Geta's protection under Providentia, who would equally become the cause of his death.

Caracalla went on to order a very thorough "damnatio memoriae", or "damnation of memory" on Geta. This involved destroying any depictions of Geta to wipe him from the historical record. This extended to coinage, and coins that reached the Imperial Palace were melted down and re-struck in Caracalla's image.

This makes the denarius of Geta just a little more special. It's a constant reminder of Caracalla's actions against his own brother, and Geta's unfortunate end. It's also a surviving record and image of Geta, that Caracalla couldn't quite reach to destroy.
